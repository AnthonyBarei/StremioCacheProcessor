options to add to movie card :
    - display full metadata
    - cancel all websocket actions (checking download, download)
    - correct metadata by choosing in stremio API !


Add Plex metadata manager if possible (as command line in config) : 
    After a bunch of tests, this is not recommended since kometa is supposed to be added as CRON on computer.
    Also it will eat a lot of resources if allowing several execution of kometa through several MediaCards

handle multiple watch possibilities (stremio, qbittorrent) wich means that each entity must have their own watch method
qbittorent will be tricky since there is the possibility of downloading multiple files for one torrent
in that case select first file 


DONE :
- Detect event when files are created in stremio cache !
- make the copy icon colored when ready to copy cache files ! 
- Add Plex Server management
- Button on home to reload manually the metadatas (redetect folders in server)
- Button on MovieCard to retry detecting the stremio state downloading 
- Better display of the stremio state on MovieCard
